# GSD-T: Promote Debt — Convert Tech Debt Items to Milestones

You are converting selected tech debt items into formal milestones on the project roadmap.

## Step 1: Load Context

Read:
1. `.gsd-t/techdebt.md` — the debt register
2. `.gsd-t/roadmap.md` — current milestone plan
3. `.gsd-t/progress.md` — what's in progress

## Step 1.5: Graph-Enhanced Impact Radius

If `.gsd-t/graph/meta.json` exists (graph index is available):
1. For each debt item, query `getCallers` on the affected entity to calculate impact radius — items with more callers have higher blast radius and may warrant higher priority
2. Include caller counts in the promotable items display to help the user prioritize

If graph is not available, skip this step.

## Step 2: Identify Items to Promote

From $ARGUMENTS, determine which items to promote:
- Specific IDs: "TD-001, TD-003" → promote those exact items
- Category: "security" → promote all security items marked as milestone candidates
- Severity: "critical" → promote all critical items
- Suggested group: "Security Hardening" → use the suggested grouping from the scan
- "all" → promote all items marked `Milestone candidate: YES`

If $ARGUMENTS is empty or vague, show the user all promotable items:
```
Promotable tech debt items:

  TD-001: [CRITICAL] SQL injection in user search — effort: small
  TD-003: [CRITICAL] Hardcoded API key in config — effort: small  
  TD-010: [HIGH] N+1 queries on dashboard — effort: medium
  TD-012: [HIGH] No rate limiting on auth endpoints — effort: small

Suggested groupings:
  1. "Security Hardening" — TD-001, TD-003, TD-012
  2. "Performance" — TD-010

Which items or groups should I promote to milestones?
```

## Step 3: Create Milestones

For each group of promoted items, create a milestone entry.

Determine placement in the roadmap:
- **CRITICAL items**: Insert BEFORE the next unstarted feature milestone
- **HIGH items**: Insert AFTER current in-progress milestone
- **MEDIUM/LOW items**: Append to end of roadmap

Append to `.gsd-t/roadmap.md`:

```markdown
---

## Milestone {N}: {name} — Tech Debt
**Source**: Promoted from tech debt scan ({date})
**Items**: {TD-001, TD-003, TD-012}
**Goal**: {what "done" looks like}
**Scope**:
- {remediation 1 from techdebt.md}
- {remediation 2 from techdebt.md}
**Success criteria**:
- [ ] {each debt item resolved and verified}
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] {item-specific criteria from techdebt.md}
**Estimated effort**: {combined effort assessment}
**Priority**: {CRITICAL — before next feature | HIGH — soon | MEDIUM — planned}
```

## Step 4: Update Tech Debt Register

In `.gsd-t/techdebt.md`, mark promoted items:
```markdown
- **Promoted**: [x] — Milestone {N}: {milestone name}
```

## Step 5: Update Progress

In `.gsd-t/progress.md`:
- Add new milestones to the table
- Log promotion in Decision Log: "{date}: Promoted {N} tech debt items to Milestone {N}: {name}"
- Reorder milestones if critical items were inserted

## Step 6: Document Ripple

After promoting debt items to milestones, update affected documentation:

### Always update:
1. **`.gsd-t/progress.md`** — Already updated in Step 5, verify Decision Log includes promotion rationale

### Check if affected:
2. **`docs/requirements.md`** — If promoted debt items imply new or changed requirements (e.g., security requirements from a security hardening milestone), add them
3. **`docs/architecture.md`** — If promoted debt involves architectural changes, note planned modifications
4. **`CLAUDE.md`** — If promotion changes the project's priority order or introduces new constraints, add them
5. **`README.md`** — If the roadmap change affects what's documented in README (e.g., known issues section), update it

### Skip what's not affected.

## Step 7: Test Verification

Before reporting:

1. **Run existing tests**: Execute the full test suite to confirm current state — promoted debt milestones should not change code yet
2. **Verify passing**: Document any pre-existing failures that relate to the promoted debt items — these validate the promotion was warranted
3. **Note test requirements**: For each promoted milestone, note what tests will need to be added or updated during execution

## Step 8: Report

Present:
1. Milestones created (with item list)
2. Updated roadmap order
3. Any impact on in-progress work
4. Recommended next action
