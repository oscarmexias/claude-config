# GSD-T: Complete Milestone — Archive and Tag Release

You are finalizing a completed milestone. Your job is to archive the milestone documentation, create a git tag, and prepare for the next milestone.

This command is:
- **Auto-invoked** at the end of `/user:gsd-t-wave` after verify passes
- **Standalone** when user wants to manually close a milestone

## Step 1: Verify Completion

Read:
1. `.gsd-t/progress.md` — confirm status is VERIFIED
2. `.gsd-t/verify-report.md` — confirm all checks passed

If status is not VERIFIED:
"⚠️ Milestone not yet verified. Run `/user:gsd-t-verify` first, or use `--force` to complete anyway."

If `--force` flag provided, proceed with warning in archive.

## Step 1.25: Graph-Enhanced Completion Check

If `.gsd-t/graph/meta.json` exists (graph index is available):
1. Query `getEntitiesByDomain` to validate all planned entities were implemented — compare against domain task lists
2. Query `findDeadCode` to flag unreachable implementations that may indicate incomplete wiring or orphaned code
3. If missing entities or significant dead code found, block completion and report gaps

If graph is not available, skip this step.

## Step 1.5: Smoke Test Artifact Gate (MANDATORY — Categories 2 and 7)

Before archiving, verify that high-risk features have testable artifacts. This gate catches what code review and unit tests cannot.

**Scan this milestone's domains for any of the following:**
- Audio capture/playback, speech recognition/synthesis
- GPU/WebGPU/WebGL compute or rendering
- ML inference, model loading, quantized model execution
- Background workers, service workers, IPC channels
- Native APIs (camera, bluetooth, filesystem, microphone)
- WebAssembly modules
- Any feature whose only prior "test" was manual user interaction

**For each high-risk feature found:**

1. Check that a smoke test script exists (in `scripts/`, `tests/`, or `.gsd-t/smoke-tests/`)
2. Check that the script was run and passed (evidence in token-log.md, CI output, or a `.gsd-t/smoke-tests/{feature}.md` file with run results)
3. If manual steps remain unavoidable: `.gsd-t/smoke-tests/{feature}.md` must exist documenting exact steps and confirming they passed

**If any high-risk feature lacks a smoke test artifact → BLOCK completion.**
Do not proceed to archiving. Create the smoke test now, run it, confirm it passes, then continue.

> This gate exists because complete-milestone is the last opportunity to catch "shipped blind" features before they become user-facing bugs requiring 15 debug sessions to resolve.

## Step 2: Gap Analysis Gate

After verification passes, run a gap analysis against `docs/requirements.md` scoped to this milestone's deliverables:

1. Identify which requirements this milestone was supposed to satisfy (from domain scopes, tasks, and milestone definition)
2. Run `gsd-t-gap-analysis` against those requirements, comparing spec to actual code
3. If **all gaps resolved** (100% Implemented) → proceed to Step 2
4. If **gaps found** (Partial, Incorrect, or Not Implemented):
   a. Auto-fix: execute remediation for each gap (prioritize Critical → High → Medium)
   b. Run affected tests (unit + integration + Playwright E2E if configured)
   c. Re-run `gsd-t-verify` to confirm fixes don't break anything
   d. Re-run gap analysis to confirm gaps are resolved
   e. If gaps remain after **2 fix cycles** → STOP and report unresolved gaps to user

This is a **mandatory gate** — the milestone cannot be archived with known gaps against its requirements.

## Step 2.5: Distillation — Extract Milestone Patterns

Before archiving, extract learning from the event stream to improve future runs.

1. Check if `.gsd-t/events/` exists and has any `.jsonl` files for this milestone period
   - If no events files found: skip distillation (log "No events recorded — distillation skipped"), continue to Step 3
   - If event-writer not installed (`node ~/.claude/scripts/gsd-t-event-writer.js 2>/dev/null || true`): skip gracefully

2. Parse events: scan `.gsd-t/events/*.jsonl` for events with `"outcome":"failure"` or `"outcome":"learning"`

3. Group by `reasoning` field value — count occurrences of each distinct reasoning string

4. For each group with ≥ 3 occurrences:
   - Formulate a concrete rule (e.g., "Always read X before modifying Y — failed 4 times without this")
   - Present to user: "Pattern found {N} times: {reasoning}. Proposed rule: '{rule}'. Add to CLAUDE.md? [y/n]"
   - **Wait for user confirmation before writing** (Destructive Action Guard — CLAUDE.md changes require approval)
   - If approved: append the rule to CLAUDE.md under the relevant section
   - Write event: `node ~/.claude/scripts/gsd-t-event-writer.js --type distillation --command gsd-t-complete-milestone --reasoning "{rule}" --outcome success || true`

5. If no patterns found (fewer than 3 occurrences): log "Distillation complete — no repeating patterns found", continue to Step 3

## Step 3: Gather Milestone Artifacts

Collect all files related to this milestone:
- `.gsd-t/progress.md` (current state)
- `.gsd-t/verify-report.md`
- `.gsd-t/impact-report.md` (if exists)
- `.gsd-t/test-coverage.md` (if exists)
- `.gsd-t/domains/*/` (all domain folders)
- `.gsd-t/contracts/` (snapshot)

## Step 4: Create Archive

Create milestone archive directory:

```
.gsd-t/milestones/{milestone-name}-{date}/
├── progress.md           # Final state
├── verify-report.md      # Verification results
├── impact-report.md      # Impact analysis (if any)
├── test-coverage.md      # Test sync report (if any)
├── summary.md            # Generated summary (see below)
├── contracts/            # Contract snapshot at completion
│   └── ...
└── domains/              # Domain artifacts
    └── ...
```

## Step 5: Generate Summary

Create `summary.md`:

```markdown
# Milestone Complete: {name}

**Completed**: {date}
**Duration**: {start date} → {end date}
**Status**: {VERIFIED | FORCED}

## What Was Built
{Extract from progress.md and domain scopes}

## Domains
| Domain | Tasks Completed | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| {name} | {N} | {summary} |

## Contracts Defined/Updated
- {contract}: {new | updated | unchanged}

## Key Decisions
{Extract from Decision Log in progress.md}

## Issues Encountered
{Extract any remediation tasks or blocked items}

## Test Coverage
- Tests added: {N}
- Tests updated: {N}
- Coverage: {if known}

## Git Tag
`{tag-name}`

## Files Changed
{Summary of files created/modified/deleted}
```

## Step 6: Bump Version

GSD-T tracks project version in `.gsd-t/progress.md` using semantic versioning: `Major.Minor.Patch`

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major rework, v1 launch
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, completed feature milestones
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, minor improvements, cleanup milestones

Determine the version bump based on the milestone:
1. Read current version from `.gsd-t/progress.md`
2. Assess milestone scope:
   - Was this a major/breaking milestone? → bump **major**, reset minor to 0, reset patch to **10**
   - Was this a feature milestone? → bump **minor**, reset patch to **10**
   - Was this a bugfix/cleanup/debt milestone? → bump **patch** (increment by 1)
   - **Patch numbers are always 2 digits (≥10).** After any minor/major reset, start at 10, never 0 or 1.
3. Update version in `.gsd-t/progress.md`
4. If a package manifest exists (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.), update its version to match
5. Update `README.md` version badge or version reference if present
6. Include version in the milestone summary and git tag

## Step 7: Clean Working State

Reset `.gsd-t/` for next milestone:

1. Archive current domains → `.gsd-t/milestones/{name}/domains/`
2. Clear `.gsd-t/domains/` (empty, ready for next partition)
3. Archive current reports → milestone folder
4. Clear `.gsd-t/impact-report.md`, `.gsd-t/test-coverage.md`
5. Update `.gsd-t/progress.md`:

```markdown
# GSD-T Progress

## Version: {new version}
## Current Milestone
None — ready for next milestone

## Completed Milestones
| Milestone | Version | Completed | Tag |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
| {name} | {version} | {date} | v{version} |
| {previous} | {version} | {date} | v{version} |

## Decision Log
- {date}: [success] Milestone "{name}" completed — {summary of what was built}. v{version}
{Keep all prior decision log entries — they are valuable context}
```

## Step 8: Update README.md

If `README.md` exists, update it to reflect the completed milestone:
- Add or update a **Features** / **What's Included** section with capabilities delivered
- Update version number if displayed in README
- Update setup instructions if infrastructure changed
- Update tech stack if new dependencies were added
- Keep existing user content — merge, don't overwrite

If `README.md` doesn't exist, create one with project name, description, version, tech stack, setup instructions, and link to `docs/`.

## Step 9: Document Ripple

Before creating the git tag, verify all documentation is up to date:

### Always update:
1. **`.gsd-t/progress.md`** — Already updated in Step 6, verify it's complete with version and milestone state
2. **`README.md`** — Already updated in Step 7, verify it reflects all delivered capabilities

### Check if affected:
3. **`docs/requirements.md`** — Verify all requirements delivered in this milestone are marked as complete
4. **`docs/architecture.md`** — Verify the architecture doc matches the current system state after all milestone work
5. **`docs/workflows.md`** — Verify any workflows added or changed during the milestone are documented
6. **`docs/infrastructure.md`** — If infrastructure changed during the milestone (new services, new deployment steps), verify it's documented
7. **`CLAUDE.md`** — Verify any conventions established during the milestone are captured
8. **`.gsd-t/techdebt.md`** — Verify any debt resolved during the milestone is marked done, and any new debt discovered is logged

### This is the LAST GATE before tagging — nothing should be undocumented.

## Step 10: Test Verification

Verify the milestone is truly complete:

1. **Run the full test suite**: Execute ALL tests — unit, integration, and E2E
2. **Run Playwright E2E** (if configured): Detect `playwright.config.*` or Playwright in dependencies. If present, run the full Playwright suite. If specs are missing or stale, invoke `gsd-t-test-sync` first.
3. **Verify all pass**: Every test must pass. If any fail, fix before tagging (up to 2 attempts)
4. **Compare to baseline**: If a test baseline was recorded at milestone start, verify coverage has improved or at minimum not regressed
5. **Log test results**: Include test pass/fail counts in the milestone summary (Step 4)

## Step 11: Create Git Tag

```bash
# Stage any remaining .gsd-t changes
git add .gsd-t/

# Commit the archive
git commit -m "milestone({milestone-name}): complete and archive v{version}"

# Create annotated tag with version
git tag -a "v{version}" -m "v{version} — Milestone: {name}

{Brief description from summary}

Domains: {list}
Verified: {date}"
```

## Step 12: Report Completion

```
✅ Milestone "{name}" completed — v{version}

📁 Archived to: .gsd-t/milestones/{name}-{date}/
🏷️  Tagged as: v{version}

Summary:
- Version: {previous version} → {new version}
- Domains completed: {N}
- Tasks completed: {N}
- Contracts: {N} defined/updated
- Tests: {N} added/updated

Next steps:
- Push tags: git push origin v{version}
- Start next milestone: /user:gsd-t-milestone "{next name}"
- Or view roadmap: /user:gsd-t-status
```

## Step 13: Update Roadmap (if exists)

If `.gsd-t/roadmap.md` exists:
- Mark this milestone as complete
- Update any dependent milestones
- Highlight next recommended milestone

## Error Handling

### If verify failed:
"Cannot complete — verification found issues. Address them first or use `--force`."

### If no milestone active:
"No active milestone to complete. Run `/user:gsd-t-status` to see state."

### If git operations fail:
- Still create archive
- Report git error
- Provide manual tag command
