# GSD-T: Execute — Run Domain Tasks (Solo or Parallel)

You are the lead agent coordinating task execution across domains. Choose solo or team mode based on the plan.

## Step 1: Load State

Read:
1. `CLAUDE.md` — check for **Branch Guard** (`Expected branch` field)
2. `.gsd-t/progress.md`
3. `.gsd-t/contracts/` — all contracts
4. `.gsd-t/contracts/integration-points.md` — dependency graph
5. `.gsd-t/domains/*/tasks.md` — all task lists

**Branch check (before any work):**
Run `git branch --show-current`. If CLAUDE.md declares an expected branch and you're on a different branch, STOP and warn the user. Do NOT execute tasks on the wrong branch.

Identify:
- Which tasks are already complete (check progress.md)
- Which tasks are unblocked (no pending dependencies)
- Which tasks are blocked (waiting on checkpoints)

## Step 1.5: Graph-Enhanced Domain Isolation Check (if available)

If `.gsd-t/graph/meta.json` exists, run graph queries before execution begins:

1. **Reindex** (if stale): `query('reindex', { force: false })` — ensure graph reflects current code
2. **Domain boundary check**: For each domain about to execute, `query('getEntitiesByDomain', { domain })` — verify the domain's entities match its scope.md
3. **Pre-execution snapshot**: Record entity counts per domain — after execution, compare to detect scope creep (domain agent modified entities outside its domain)
4. **Cross-domain dependencies**: `query('getDomainBoundaryViolations', {})` — flag existing violations before work begins so they aren't confused with new violations introduced during execution

After each domain completes, re-run `getDomainBoundaryViolations` and diff against pre-execution snapshot. If new violations appear, flag them immediately before proceeding to the next domain.

## Step 2: QA Subagent

In solo mode, QA runs inside each domain subagent (see Step 3). In team mode, the lead spawns QA subagents at each domain checkpoint using the pattern below.

**QA subagent prompt:**
```
Task subagent (general-purpose, model: haiku):
"Run the full test suite for this project and report pass/fail counts.
Read .gsd-t/contracts/ for contract definitions.
Write edge case tests for any new code paths in this task: {task description}.
Report: test pass/fail status and any coverage gaps found."
```

If QA found issues, append each to `.gsd-t/qa-issues.md` (create with header `| Date | Command | Step | Model | Duration(s) | Severity | Finding |` if missing):
`| {DT_START} | gsd-t-execute | Step 2 | haiku | {DURATION}s | {severity} | {finding} |`

## Step 3: Choose Execution Mode

### Wave Scheduling (read first)

Before choosing solo or team mode, read the `## Wave Execution Groups` section in `.gsd-t/contracts/integration-points.md` (added by the plan phase).

**If wave groups are present**:
- Execute wave-by-wave: complete all tasks in Wave 1 before starting Wave 2
- Within each wave, tasks marked as parallel-safe can run concurrently (team mode) or be interleaved (solo mode)
- At each wave boundary: run the CHECKPOINT — verify contract compliance — before proceeding
- File conflict detection: if two tasks in the same wave list the same file in their `scope.md` ownership, move one to the next wave

**If no wave groups are defined** (older plans): fall back to the `Execution Order` list.

### Solo Mode (default) — Domain Subagent Pattern

Each domain's work runs in an isolated Task subagent with a fresh context window. The orchestrator (this agent) stays lightweight — it only spawns subagents, collects summaries, verifies checkpoints, and updates progress.

**OBSERVABILITY LOGGING (MANDATORY) — repeat for every domain subagent spawn:**

Before spawning — run via Bash:
`T_START=$(date +%s) && DT_START=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") && TOK_START=${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_USED:-0} && TOK_MAX=${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_MAX:-200000}`

After subagent returns — run via Bash:
`T_END=$(date +%s) && DT_END=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") && TOK_END=${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_USED:-0} && DURATION=$((T_END-T_START))`

Compute tokens and compaction:
- No compaction (TOK_END >= TOK_START): `TOKENS=$((TOK_END-TOK_START))`, COMPACTED=null
- Compaction detected (TOK_END < TOK_START): `TOKENS=$(((TOK_MAX-TOK_START)+TOK_END))`, COMPACTED=$DT_END

Append to `.gsd-t/token-log.md` (create with header `| Datetime-start | Datetime-end | Command | Step | Model | Duration(s) | Notes | Tokens | Compacted |` if missing):
`| {DT_START} | {DT_END} | gsd-t-execute | domain:{domain-name} | sonnet | {DURATION}s | {N} tasks, {pass/fail} | {TOKENS} | {COMPACTED} |`

**For each domain (in wave order), spawn:**

**Pre-task experience retrieval (before spawning each domain subagent):**
Run via Bash:
`grep -i "\[failure\]\|\[learning\]" .gsd-t/progress.md | grep -i "{domain-name}" | tail -5`

If results found:
- Prepend a `## ⚠️ Past Failures (retrieve before acting)` block to the subagent prompt (max 5 lines from results)
- Write event via Bash: `node ~/.claude/scripts/gsd-t-event-writer.js --type experience_retrieval --command gsd-t-execute --reasoning "{N past failures found for {domain-name}}" --outcome null || true`

If no results found: proceed normally (no warning block, no event write).

```
Task subagent (general-purpose, model: sonnet, mode: bypassPermissions):
"You are executing all tasks for the {domain-name} domain.

Read before starting (load your own context — do not assume anything):
1. CLAUDE.md — project conventions (CRITICAL)
2. .gsd-t/domains/{domain-name}/scope.md — what you own
3. .gsd-t/domains/{domain-name}/constraints.md — patterns to follow
4. ALL files in .gsd-t/contracts/ — your interfaces
5. .gsd-t/domains/{domain-name}/tasks.md — your task list
6. .gsd-t/contracts/integration-points.md — wave order and checkpoints

Execute each incomplete task in order:
1. Read task description, files list, and contract refs
2. Read relevant contracts — implement EXACTLY what they specify
3. Destructive Action Guard: if task involves DROP TABLE, schema changes that lose
   data, removing working modules, or replacing architecture patterns → write a
   NEEDS-APPROVAL entry to .gsd-t/deferred-items.md, skip the task, continue
4. Implement the task
5. Verify acceptance criteria are met
6. Write comprehensive tests (MANDATORY — no feature code without test code):
   - Unit/integration: happy path + edge cases + error cases for every new/changed function
   - Playwright E2E (if UI/routes/flows changed): new specs for new features, cover
     all modes, form validation, empty/loading/error states, common edge cases
   - If no test framework exists: set one up as part of this task
7. Run ALL tests — unit, integration, Playwright. Fix failures (up to 2 attempts)
8. Run Pre-Commit Gate checklist from CLAUDE.md — update all affected docs BEFORE committing
9. Commit immediately: feat({domain-name}/task-{N}): {description}
10. Update .gsd-t/progress.md — mark task complete; prefix the Decision Log entry with an outcome tag based on how the task completed:
    - Task completed successfully on first attempt → prefix `[success]`
    - Task completed after a fix (required debugging or correction) → prefix `[learning]`
    - Task deferred to .gsd-t/deferred-items.md → prefix `[deferred]`
    - Task failed after 3 attempts → prefix `[failure]`
11. Spawn QA subagent (model: haiku) after each task:
    'Run the full test suite. Read .gsd-t/contracts/ for definitions.
     Report: pass/fail counts and coverage gaps.'
    If QA fails, fix before proceeding. Append issues to .gsd-t/qa-issues.md.

Deviation rules:
- Bug blocking progress → fix, max 3 attempts; if still blocked, log to
  .gsd-t/deferred-items.md and continue to next task
- Missing dependency task requires → add minimum needed, document in commit message
- Non-trivial blocker → fix and log to .gsd-t/deferred-items.md
- Architectural change required → write NEEDS-APPROVAL to .gsd-t/deferred-items.md,
  skip the task, continue — never self-approve structural changes

When all tasks are complete, report:
- Tasks completed: N/N
- Test results: pass/fail counts
- Commits made: list of commit hashes
- Deferred items (if any): list from .gsd-t/deferred-items.md"
```

**After each domain subagent returns (orchestrator responsibilities):**
1. Log to `.gsd-t/token-log.md` (see observability block above)
2. Check `.gsd-t/deferred-items.md` for any `NEEDS-APPROVAL` entries — if found, STOP and present to user before spawning the next domain
3. If a CHECKPOINT is reached per `integration-points.md`, verify contract compliance (see Step 4) before proceeding to the next wave/domain
4. Update `.gsd-t/progress.md` with domain completion status

### Team Mode (when agent teams are enabled)
Spawn teammates for domains within the same wave. Only domains in the same wave can run in parallel — do not spawn teammates for domains in different waves simultaneously:

```
Create an agent team for execution:

ALL TEAMMATES must read before starting:
1. CLAUDE.md — project conventions (CRITICAL)
2. Your domain's scope.md — what you own
3. Your domain's constraints.md — what you must/must not do
4. ALL files in .gsd-t/contracts/ — your interfaces
5. Your domain's tasks.md — your work

RULES FOR ALL TEAMMATES:
- **Destructive Action Guard**: NEVER drop tables, remove columns, delete data, replace architecture patterns, or remove working modules without messaging the lead first. The lead must get user approval before any destructive action proceeds.
- Only modify files listed in your domain's scope.md
- Implement interfaces EXACTLY as specified in contracts
- **Write comprehensive tests with every task** — no feature code without test code:
  - Unit/integration tests: happy path + edge cases + error cases for every new/changed function
  - Playwright E2E specs (if UI/routes/flows/modes changed): new specs for new features, cover all modes/flags, form validation, empty/loading/error states, common edge cases
  - Tests are part of the deliverable, not a follow-up
- If a task is marked BLOCKED, message the lead and wait
- Run the Pre-Commit Gate checklist from CLAUDE.md BEFORE every commit — update all affected docs
- After completing each task, message the lead with:
  "DONE: {domain} Task {N} - {summary of what was created/modified}"
- If you need to deviate from a contract, STOP and message the lead
- **Commit immediately after each task**: `feat({domain}/task-{N}): {description}` — do NOT batch commits
- **Deviation Rules**: (1) Bug blocking progress → fix, 3 attempts max; (2) Missing dependency → add minimum needed; (3) Blocker → fix and log to deferred-items.md; (4) Architectural change → STOP, message lead, never self-approve

Teammate assignments:
- Teammate "{domain-1}": Execute .gsd-t/domains/{domain-1}/tasks.md
- Teammate "{domain-2}": Execute .gsd-t/domains/{domain-2}/tasks.md
- Teammate "{domain-3}": Execute .gsd-t/domains/{domain-3}/tasks.md
Lead responsibilities (QA is handled via Task subagent — spawn one after each domain checkpoint):
- Use delegate mode (Shift+Tab)
- Track completions from teammate messages
- When a CHECKPOINT is reached:
  1. Pause blocked teammates
  2. Verify the gate condition (check contract compliance)
  3. Unblock waiting teammates
- Update .gsd-t/progress.md after each completion
- Resolve any contract conflicts immediately
```

## Step 4: Checkpoint Handling

When a checkpoint is reached (solo or team):

1. **Stop** execution of blocked tasks
2. **Read** the relevant contract
3. **Verify** the implemented code matches the contract:
   - API response shapes match?
   - Schema matches?
   - Component interfaces match?
   - Error handling matches?
4. **If mismatch**: Fix the implementation to match the contract, OR update the contract and notify affected domains
5. **Log** in progress.md: `CHECKPOINT {name}: PASSED/FAILED — {details}`
6. **Unblock** downstream tasks

## Step 5: Error Handling

### Contract Violation
A teammate implements something that doesn't match a contract:
1. Stop the teammate
2. Identify the deviation
3. Decide: fix implementation or update contract?
4. If updating contract, message ALL affected teammates with the change
5. Log the decision

### Merge Conflict / File Conflict
Two teammates modified the same file (shouldn't happen with good partitioning):
1. Stop both teammates
2. Identify which domain owns the file (check scope.md)
3. Non-owner reverts their changes
4. Determine if the contract needs updating to prevent recurrence
5. Log the incident

### Blocked Teammate Idle
A teammate finishes independent tasks and is waiting on a checkpoint:
1. Check if checkpoint can be expedited
2. If not, have the teammate work on documentation, tests, or code cleanup within their domain
3. Or shut down the teammate and respawn when unblocked

## Step 6: Completion

When all tasks in all domains are complete:
1. Update `.gsd-t/progress.md` — all tasks marked complete
2. Set status to `EXECUTED`
3. List any contract deviations or decisions made during execution

### Autonomy Behavior

**Level 3 (Full Auto)**: Log a brief status line (e.g., "✅ Execute complete — {N}/{N} tasks done") and auto-advance to the next phase. Do NOT wait for user input.

**Level 1–2**: Report completion summary and recommend proceeding to integrate phase. Wait for confirmation.

## Document Ripple

Execute modifies source code, so the Pre-Commit Gate (referenced in Step 9) covers document updates. For clarity, the key documents affected by execution:

### Always update:
1. **`.gsd-t/progress.md`** — Mark tasks complete, update domain status, log execution summary

### Check if affected (per task):
2. **`.gsd-t/contracts/`** — Did a task change an API endpoint, schema, or component interface? Update the contract
3. **`docs/requirements.md`** — Did a task implement or change a requirement? Mark it complete or revise
4. **`docs/architecture.md`** — Did a task add/change a component or data flow? Update it
5. **`.gsd-t/techdebt.md`** — Did a task resolve a debt item? Mark it done. Did it reveal new debt? Add it

$ARGUMENTS

## Auto-Clear

All work is committed to project files. Execute `/clear` to free the context window for the next command.
