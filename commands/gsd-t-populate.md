# GSD-T: Populate — Auto-Populate Documentation from Existing Codebase

Scan this codebase and populate the GSD-T documentation. Analyze the actual code — don't ask me questions.

## For docs/requirements.md:
- Scan routes/endpoints/UI to identify functional requirements (REQ-###)
- Scan package.json/requirements.txt/configs for technical requirements (TECH-###)
- Scan tests, configs, README for non-functional requirements (NFR-###)
- Cross-reference tests to populate the Test Coverage table

## For docs/architecture.md:
- Write a System Overview from the folder structure and entry points
- Document each major Component: purpose, location, dependencies, key methods
- Extract Data Models from schema files, migrations, or ORM models (fields, types, relationships, indexes)
- Document API Structure from route definitions (endpoints, methods, auth, request/response)
- Identify External Integrations from API clients, SDKs, env vars
- Note any Design Decisions found in comments, README, or ADR files

## For docs/workflows.md:
- Trace User Workflows from routes/handlers (registration, login, core features)
- Document Technical Workflows from cron jobs, queue workers, scheduled tasks
- Document API Workflows for complex multi-step operations
- Document Integration Workflows for any external system syncing

## For docs/infrastructure.md:
- Extract Quick Reference commands from package.json scripts, Makefile, README
- Document Local Development setup from README, docker-compose, .env.example
- Document Database commands from migrations, scripts, ORM config
- List Credentials and Secrets from .env.example (local) and any secret manager configs
- Document Deployment from CI/CD configs, Dockerfiles, cloud configs
- Document Logging and Monitoring from any logging setup or dashboard configs

## Graph-Enhanced Population

If `.gsd-t/graph/meta.json` exists (graph index is available):
1. Use `getEntities` and `getImports` to auto-populate architecture docs more accurately — entity relationships map directly to component diagrams and data flow sections
2. Use `getEntitiesByDomain` to pre-fill domain scope files with precise file ownership

If graph is not available, rely on filesystem scanning as usual.

## For .gsd-t/progress.md:
- Set Milestone 1: "Documentation Baseline"
- Set status: VERIFIED
- Log today session: "GSD-T documentation populated from existing codebase"

## Reconstruct Decision Log from Git History

Rebuild the progress.md Decision Log from the project's commit history:

1. **Read existing Decision Log entries** — note what's already recorded to avoid duplicates
2. **Run `git log --reverse --format="%ai|%s"`** — get all commits with timestamps and messages
3. **Filter meaningful commits** — skip merge commits, trivial whitespace/formatting-only commits
4. **Generate entries** in the standard format:
   ```
   - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: {commit summary} — {brief context from commit message}
   ```
5. **Group by date** — if multiple commits on the same day cover the same logical change, combine them into one entry rather than listing each commit separately
6. **Merge with existing entries** — insert reconstructed entries chronologically, keeping any hand-written entries that already exist (they may have richer context than commit messages)
7. **Mark the reconstruction** — add a note at the top of the reconstructed section:
   ```
   (Entries before {date} reconstructed from git history)
   ```

### What to include:
- Feature additions, bug fixes, refactors
- Config/dependency changes
- Documentation updates
- Version bumps and releases
- Any commit that modified documents, scripts, or code

### What to exclude:
- Pure merge commits with no additional context
- Commits that only change whitespace or formatting
- Duplicate entries already in the Decision Log

## Document Ripple

After populating all documentation, verify cross-references:

### Always update:
1. **`.gsd-t/progress.md`** — Set milestone and log the population session
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — If it exists, verify it references all populated docs. If conventions were discovered during population, add them

### Check if affected:
3. **`.gsd-t/contracts/`** — If API or schema contracts exist, verify they match what was documented in architecture/requirements
4. **`.gsd-t/techdebt.md`** — If population revealed inconsistencies, missing tests, or debt, log items
5. **`README.md`** — If it exists, verify it's consistent with the populated docs. If not, update it

### Skip what's not affected.

## Test Verification

After populating documentation:

1. **Run existing tests**: Execute the full test suite to establish the current baseline
2. **Verify passing**: Document what passes and what fails — this is the project's test starting point
3. **Cross-reference**: Verify that test files mentioned in `docs/requirements.md` Test Coverage table actually exist and pass

Replace all "{Project Name}" with the actual project name (from package.json, README, or folder name).
Replace all "{Date}" with today date.
Fill every section with real findings. If a section has nothing (e.g., no cron jobs), write "None" instead of placeholder text.

## Auto-Clear

All work is committed to project files. Execute `/clear` to free the context window for the next command.
